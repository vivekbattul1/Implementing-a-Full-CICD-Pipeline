2. Installing Docker
=====================
In order to begin using Docker, you need to know how to install it. I will guide you through the process of installing Docker within a CentOS 7 environment. After completing this you should have an understanding of how to install Docker.

If you want more information, or you want to know how to install Docker in a non-CentOS 7 environment, be sure to check out the official Docker install documentation: https://docs.docker.com/install/


Installing Docker:
------------------
You can find installation instructions for a variety of systems at https://docs.docker.com/install/

On CentOs, you can install it like so:
$ sudo yum install docker

Docker includes a background process that you need to start and enable:
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl enable docker

Verify the instllation with:
$ sudo docker info
